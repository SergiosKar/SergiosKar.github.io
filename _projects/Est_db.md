Architectured and developed a full-stack web application for the European Training Foundation (ETF).
The purpose of the app is to store, organize and manipulate their data, perform validations and verifications on them and build reports
for internal or external use.

The user is able to add, edit or delete data from the browser using an excel-like table,
create reports based on selected filters and build interactive visualizations such as Pie Charts, Bar Charts and Maps.
