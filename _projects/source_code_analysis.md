To measure the quality and the robustness of web apps, we built a library to analyze the source code , both on the frontend and the backend and create automatic reports. The system extracts wide-used metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead effort and Maintainability index and present them in reports with charts and tables for better comprehension and exploration of the code.

The calculation of the metrics is performed with R, as the source code is parsed and analyzed using text processing methods. The metrics and insights for all the diferrent files are merged to a single report, which include pie charts, bar charts and other intuitive graphs. Currently the library supports Javascipt and PHP.
