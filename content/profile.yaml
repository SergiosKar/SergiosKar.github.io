  about: |
    My name is Sergios and I am a Machine Learning Engineer. My main goal is to educate people about Deep Learning and help companies build their Artificial Intelligence products. Contributing to the AI community has been the common denominator to all my endeavors.

    I started my journey with a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering and I quickly became super interested in Machine Learning. I have worked as a Data Scientist, as a freelancer ML Engineer with small start-ups, and as a Software Engineer in big tech.

    AI Summer is the project that I'm most proud of. Over the past year, we reached a huge audience of AI researchers and aspiring ML Engineers, who are coming to our blog for learning and discussing about AI.

    My last role in Hubspot as a part of the Machine Learning Infrastructure team sparked my interest in MLOps, which has been my main focus in the past months. The result? My first book titled "Deep Learning in Production".
