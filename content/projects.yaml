- name: Master thesis - Development of computer vision framework with deep learning techniques	
  url: https://nemertes.lis.upatras.gr/jspui/handle/10889/10955?mode=full
  description: Development of Computer Vision framework based on deep learning and
              GPU programming. We designed a convolutional and full connected neural network library from scratch
              for object recognition in images. The training of the network and the computation of its output run on
              GPU, programmed with OpenCV, OpenCL and C++
