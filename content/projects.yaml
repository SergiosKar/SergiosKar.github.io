  description: |
    As part of my thesis during my MEng degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering , we developed a Computer Vision library that allows the user to recognize objects in images using deep learning. To accomplish that, the user/developer can define his own neural network architecture and train his own images on it.
  
    The system supports fully connected and convolutional neural networks , which we implement in C++ from scratch. To speed up the training, we decided use parallelization and execute the training in GPU, which we programmed with the OpenCL library. Also OpenCV was used to parse and read the images and do all the necessary preprocessing of the dataset.

    Architectured and developed a full-stack web application for the European Training Foundation (ETF). The purpose of the app is to store, organize and manipulate their data, perform validations and verifications on them and build reports for internal or external use.

    The user is able to add, edit or delete data from the browser using an excel-like table, create reports based on selected filters and build interactive visualizations such as Pie Charts, Bar Charts and Maps.

  description:  Developed and published an Android app with a NoSQL database and a server
                hosted in Google cloud. The app connects users via common interests in movies and tv shows and it organically
                grew to more than 500 users within the first two weeks.
