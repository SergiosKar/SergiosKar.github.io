My main goal is to educate people about Deep Learning and help companies build their Artificial Intelligence products. Contributing to the AI community has been the common denominator to all my endeavors.\n\nI started my journey with a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering and I quickly became super interested in Machine Learning. I have worked as a Data Scientist, as a freelancer ML Engineer with small start-ups, and as a Software Engineer in big tech.\n\nAI Summer is the project that I'm most proud of. Over the past year, we reached a huge audience of AI researchers and aspiring ML Engineers, who are coming to our blog for learning and discussing about AI.\n\nMy last role in Hubspot as a part of the Machine Learning Infrastructure team sparked my interest in MLOps, which has been my main focus in the past months. The result? My first book titled \"Deep Learning in Production\".\n","budget":{"currency":"$","default":10,"max":30,"min":5},"company":"AI Summer","email":"sergioskarag@gmail.com","focus":"Deep Learning and MLOps","focus_url":"https://amzn.to/3oa50Vj","for_hire":false,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f557c04fd57d3cd2f2030740f47625fc/17fa0/profile.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f557c04fd57d3cd2f2030740f47625fc/17fa0/profile.jpg 144w,\n/static/f557c04fd57d3cd2f2030740f47625fc/d75f5/profile.jpg 288w","sizes":"144px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f557c04fd57d3cd2f2030740f47625fc/7512d/profile.webp 144w,\n/static/f557c04fd57d3cd2f2030740f47625fc/654e6/profile.webp 288w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"144px"}]},"width":144,"height":144}},"publicURL":"/static/f557c04fd57d3cd2f2030740f47625fc/profile.jpeg"},"initials":"SK","location":"Athens, Greece","name":"Sergios Karagiannakos","profession":"Machine Learning Engineer","relocation":false,"scholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QaI3OWMAAAAJ&hl=en","skills":["Deep Learning","Machine Learning Infrastructure","Computer Vision"],"tools":["Pytorch","Tensorflow","Docker","Kubernetes"]},"social":{"nodes":[{"name":"linkedin","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergios-karagiannakos"},{"name":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/KarSergios"},{"name":"github","url":"https://github.com/SergiosKar"},{"name":"goodreads","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22021693.Sergios_Karagiannakos"},{"name":"medium","url":"https://medium.com/@SergiosKar"}]},"history":{"nodes":[{"company":"AI Summer","period":"June 2018 - present","position":"Founder and Deep Learning Writer","url":"https://theaisummer.com"},{"company":"HubSpot","period":"November 2019 - November 2020","position":"Software Engineer in the Machine Learning Infrastructure team","url":"https://www.hubspot.com/"},{"company":"Eworx SA","period":"January 2017 - December 2017","position":"Data Scientist","url":"https://www.eworx.gr/"},{"company":"Freelance Sofware Engineer","period":"April 2016 - June 2018","position":"Independent contractor with startups","url":null},{"company":"University of Patras","period":"September 2012- September 2017","position":"MEng Electrical and Computer Engineer","url":null}]},"projects":{"nodes":[{"description":"Deep Leanrning in Production explores how to develop, deploy and scale Deep Learning pipelines with Tensorflow.
